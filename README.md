### 2degrees Broadband Usage Monitor extension for Chrome

*Previously known as Snap Usage Monitor.*

âš  <b>2017-12-08 edit:</b>

2degrees recently changed their login and details page (resulting in parsing errors), and I've just switched ISPs, so I don't plan to continue supporting this extension at this time.

As such, I've unpublished this extension from the Chrome Web Store.

If anyone else would like to take over, please post a pull request or issue.

If you're a [2degrees Broadband](https://www.2degreesmobile.co.nz/broadband) or [Snap Prepay](https://prepay.2degreesbroadband.co.nz/) customer in New Zealand, this Chrome extension lets you view details of your data usage with the click of a button:
* Data used
* Data remaining
* Off-peak data used (if you have Uncapped Nights from 1am-7am)
* Free YouTube data used (if you have All You Can Eat YouTube)
* Average daily usage
* Billing period estimate
* Suggested daily usage
* Time remaining

And a visual progress bar that displays:
* Percentage of data used towards your limit
* How far through the billing period you are
