* Average daily usage
* Billing period estimate
* Suggested daily usage
* Time remaining
* Network status announcements

And a visual progress bar that displays:
* Percentage of data used towards your limit
* How far through the billing period you are

**Requires a Chromium-based browser built on Chromium version 27 or higher.**
